Exploratory analysis on Youtube Trending Data 

YouTube has a list of the top trending videos that measures user's’ interaction, such as the number of views/likes/comments/shares. In this project, we want to explore among the trending videos, what factor(s) can predict the trending videos get the likes/dislikes/comments.

This project will use different Machine Learning Models to conduct prediction on YouTube videos' likes, among the feature variables:
       Load in a dataset from Kaggle.
       Conduct data preprocessing and data visualization
       Create a Delta Table
       Keep track of models’ performance by conducting ‘RMSE’ and ‘R2’ evaluation with MLflow.
       Conduct feature engineering to find the most importance features.
       Conlude with findings and future adjustment.
